### No more writing down coordinates

Finding lots of beautiful landmarks you don't want to lose? Lay a few trails, plop some signs down at intersections, and voila - you've got a national park!

### Watch your connections grow

As players travel between frequented locations, a web of paths will naturally form based on movement patterns.

### Beautify your builds

No need to manually decorate the ground! Simply play around your base for long enough, and the ground will naturally become worn.
