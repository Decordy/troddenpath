*Off the Trodden Path* lays beautiful trails behind players as they travel throughout the world.

These trails (using default settings) form after walking the same path multiple times. The more a path is used, the larger it gets.

### No more writing down coordinates

As players travel between frequented locations, a web of paths naturally forms based on their movement patterns.

### Beautify your builds

No need to manually detail the ground! Simply play around your base for long enough, and the area will naturally become worn.
